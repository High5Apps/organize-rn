# DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF SHOWING OF INTEREST TO SUPPORT SHOWING OF INTEREST IN {{employer_name}}, {{petition_id}}

I am {{petitioner_name}}, {{petitioner_title}} for {{org_name}}, the petitioner in {{employer_name}}, {{petition_id}}.

The petitioner collected electronic signatures from unit employees for the purposes of its showing of interest in the following manner:

Each individual employee interested in joining our Union organizing drive downloaded the "Organize: Modern Labor Unions" app from the Android or iOS app store. The app set up Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for each employee by creating a public/private key pair on the employee's smartphone and then uploading the public key to the Organize backend servers.

Then each employee filled their name, phone number, and email address into a form in the app that contained language stating that they authorized our Union to represent them for the purpose of collective bargaining with {{employer_name}}. When each employee tapped the "Sign" button, the app used their private key to cryptographically sign all of their information, and then submitted it to the Organize backend servers. After successful submission, the "Sign" button immediately turned into an "Undo" button, allowing the employee to remove the signed card from the Organize backend servers at any time and for any reason.

The electronic signatures we're providing can be used to indpendently verify that the signature 
is that of the signatory employee, that the signature was created using the employee's smartphone, and that what was submitted is the same info seen and signed by the employee. An independent third party could verify this using the Eliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm's verify function for the eliptic curve named "secp256r1" also known as P256. As such, no  Confirmation Transmission was required.

## Directions

The template above is intended to be used as part of step 5 of the NLRB's [Steps for filing a Petition](https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/steps-for-filing-a-petition). To use this template, replace the template variables (e.g. {{employer_name}}, {{petition_id}}, etc.) with the real values relevant to your union.

## Notes

This template was created by following the guidance in the NLRB's [MEMORANDUM GC 15-08 (Revised) Guidance Memorandum on Electronic Signatures](https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4581e5edc8). Specifically, it follows the requirements outlined in section III(A)(2) on page 5 of that document. It relies heavily on the first footnote on page 6 of that document regarding PKI.

It also uses the following two NLRB example documents as references, even though neither is directly applicable to this scenario: [Example 1 Declaration to Support Showing of Interest Website](https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4581e5edc9) and [Example 2 Declaration to Support Showing of Interest Email](https://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4581e5edca).
